# SQLMesh TUI

This is a simply text user interface for SQLMesh. The goal is to provide a convenient and lightweight way to perform
basic SQLMesh operations as well as provide administrative functions and views into metadata otherwise not exposed.

Running the app now will open it up to the test fixture project. You can clone the repo and play around with the
interface.
